# controller-input

Simple, unified user input.

In a browser users have numerous ways to cause input events: they can press a key, move a mouse, touch their screen, or even move a joystick on a gamepad. `controller-input` abstracts all of this away while exposing a simple `Controller` model capable of handling and normalizing any input a user sends at it.
